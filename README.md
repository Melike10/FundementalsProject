Patika.Dev Assignment - C# Basic Applications

This project is an assignment made for Patika.dev. It contains three different console applications written in C#. Each one demonstrates the use of basic programming structures with different types of methods.

## Overview of the Project
This project consists of three different console applications:

a) Random Number Guessing Game

b) Calculator

c) Grade Point Average Calculation

Each application is designed to demonstrate the use of different types of methods:

Methods that do not take parameters and do not return a value.
Methods that do not take parameters but return a value.
Methods that take parameters and return a value.
## Technologies Used
C#: The main programming language used in this project.
.NET Core Console Application: .NET Core is used to run the console applications.
## Program Descriptions
1. Random Number Guessing Game
This program presents a game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user has 5 chances to guess the correct number. If they do not guess it correctly, the correct number is shown at the end of the game.

Method Used:

FindRandomValue(): This method does not take any parameters and does not return a value. It generates a random number and evaluates the user's guesses.
2. Calculator
This program takes two numbers and an operation type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to perform a simple calculation. The user is warned to prevent division by zero.

Method Used:

Counter(int num1, int num2, char op): This method takes two numbers and an operation type as parameters and returns the result of that operation.
3. Grade Point Average Calculation
This program takes the user's grades from three courses and calculates the average, then returns a letter grade based on the average.

Method Used:

CountGrade(): This method does not take any parameters but returns a string. It calculates the average of the user's grades and determines a letter grade accordingly.
## Installation and Running
Clone or download the project.
Run the project in an environment where .NET Core is installed.
The console will prompt the user to select a program. After entering the required information, the desired program will run.
